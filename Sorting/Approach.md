# Selection Sort:

**Approach**
- Find the smallest element in the array and exchange it with the element in the first position.
- Find the second smallest element in the array and exchange it with the element in the second position.
- Continue this process until done.

- Time Complexity  : O(n^2)
- Space Complexity : O(1)

# Bubble Sort:

**Approach**
- Traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side.
- In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. 
- This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.

- Time Complexity  : O(n^^2)
- Space Complexity : O(1)
